Based on the Hyperledger Composer Perishable Goods sample network and Steven Perry's developerWorks tutorial that customizes it.

I highly recommend going through Steven's 3 part [Hyperledger Composer Basics tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-model-test-your-blockchain-network-with-hyperledger-composer-playground/index.html) that walks you through an IOT/coldchain use case - and how to capture it in Hyperledger Composer/Fabric.

The script I use to build the blockchain network and validate transaction and event functionality is captured here:
